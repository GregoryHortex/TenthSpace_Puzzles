# TenthSpace_Puzzles
---
Here, you can help me adding puzzles for TenthSpace!
Just simply fork this repo, edit the html file and done!

## Optionally:
---
You can submit an image to the puzzle.
Just include it in the image folder found inside /reg/.

## Folder structure:
---
This is also highly important:
The main folder here is /reg/, and it's going to be your TEMPLATE! Don't edit the files in there, just simply copy the folder and rename it to /reg_sub/ (as in for regular Submission).
html files go into /reg_sub/html/.
Images go into /reg_sub/img/.
You don't have to worry about CSS Files, as i will take care of that!

## What you get from helping me:
---
You get your player name engraved in the HoF, and your puzzles will get marked with "Made by: {Name}".

## Important things:
---
If you are submitting your puzzle, please submit it in the /reg_sub/ folder you made for that.
After your submission has been requested, you may or may not make another puzzle.
